FF0F - IF : interrupt requests
FFFF - IE : interrupt enable

as far as I understand, interrupts work like this:

an event requests an interrupt
at the next cpu tick, check if IME is on and if the requested interrupt
is enabled at 0xFFFF

if so: clear the interrupt request bit
else: don't do anything

if multiple interrupts are requested, the less significant bits have the priority
