List of things to do, in no particular order.

- Implement bootstrap
- Parse command line arguments
- Implement debugger with basic commands (breakpoints, run, continue, print)
- implement SRAM / VRAM / WRAM / HRAM whatever else all this shit means
- LCDC registers
- before implementing new opcodes, make sure that the whole architecture is correct (especially reading and writing with indirect addresses)
- graphix with sdl Poggers
