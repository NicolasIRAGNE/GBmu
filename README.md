# GBmu

Trying to write a GameBoy emulator from scratch with no prior experience in electronics / emulation in general.
One of the dumbest ideas i've had so far.

### Dependencies.
Cmake version 3.13 minimum.

SDL2

That should be it i don't know

It should run on osx and linux as long as these dependencies are met. Not tested on windows.

### How to use
cd build && cmake .. && make
usage: ./gbmu <rom_file>

### Debugger 
This includes a very rudimentary debugger with very poor syntax parsing. Type help for command info.

### Does it work ?
No.

### Will it work one day ?
Maybe.
